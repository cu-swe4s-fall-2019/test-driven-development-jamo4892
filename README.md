Homework 3: Test Driven Development
September 26 2019

I ran out of time complete this assignment. Below I describe the progress I was able to make.

1. Changes to math_lib.py
Wrote functions to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a list, and wrote documentation 
for these functions.
Wrote math_lib_unittest.py. This contains unit tests for math_lib.py. Wrote documentation for these unit tests.

2. Changes to get_data.py
Wrote function to take columns from standardin, generated by gen_data.sh, and return an array of the values
in the column.

3. Changes to data_viz.py
Started writing functions to make box, histogram and box-histogram combination plots of the data generated in
get_data.py.

4. Changes .travis.yml
Added pycodestyle tests for get_data.py, data_viz.py, math_lib.py and math_lib_unittest.py. These tests 
run on the code I was able to complete for the assignment.
